            Future and Replacement: Despite its age, the A-10 remains a vital asset for the USAF. Discussions about retiring the aircraft have been ongoing, but as of now, the A-10 is expected to remain in service until at least the late 2020s, possibly being replaced by the F-35 Lightning II or other advanced platforms for CAS missions.
